				<h1>Bed Bugs</h1>
				<p>
					Bed bugs are small parasitic insects who (due to the fact they require the blood of warm blooded animals to survive) get their name from the fact that they are commonly found next to beds. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Generally, bed bugs are more of a nuisance pest than a serious health threat however in large numbers over a period of time their bits can produce severe allergic reactions. There is no evidence to indicate that they transmit any infectious disease.
				</p>
				<p style="max-width:50%;float:left;">
					Bed bugs can live up to six months at room temperature and can survive for long periods without a blood meal.They usually feed during the night, but bed bugs can be opportunistic feeders (feed whenever the opportunity is present).
				</p>
                
                <img src="../images/bedbug.jpg"/ style="float:right; max-width:40%;"> 
                
				<p style="clear:both;">Bed bugs are excellent hitch-hikers and are generally brought into the home or hotel room by stowing away in luggage.    Once they have found their new home they will lay eggs which hatch within three days and once hatched reach full maturity in around 35 days.   If undetected this can result in an explosion in numbers which makes them difficult to eradicate. </p>
				
				<p>
					In some people a Bed bug bite can become evident in as little as a few hours however in others it can take up to fourteen days.   
				</p>
				<p>
					For hotel operators with short term guests complaining about Bed bugs it is important to arrange a full inspection of the room prior to treatment as the bites may have occurred in a previous hotel.   You can do this yourself however if you have concerns over your inspection contact Raptor Pest Control to carry out a full inspection. 
				</p>
				<p>
					During any inspection it is also important to check adjacent rooms as Bed bugs will frequently hitch-hike and be carried throughout the premises. 
				</p>
                <p> Bed bugs have dorsoventrally flattened (thin) bodies, thus they can stay well hidden in narrow crevices and cracks.</p>
                
                
                <p> Bed bugs are most commonly found on mattresses, particularly along the stitchededges where there are folds that help to conceal them.They are also found:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>on bed frames </li> 
                    <li>in bed side furniture </li> 
                    <li>in picture frames </li> 
                    <li>behind wall paper</li> 
                    <li>in cracks and crevices or other areas of a room that will provide them with protection, such as carpet edges, behind skirting boards or between wooden floor boards.</li>
                <p> If you think that you have a bed bug infestation, it is important to contact us for an inspection and treatment as quickly as possible. Delay or failure to treat promptly and effectively may cause the infestation to spread to other rooms, making control more difficult and expensive. </p>
                    <p> Bed bug control is most effective when chemical and non-chemical treatments are used together. We will the discuss treatment options with you prior to our visit.</p>
                    
                    <h1> Prior to treatment</h1>
                    <p>You will get the best result if you do some preparatory work prior to treatment. <br> If bed linen is infested, wash the items in hot water and then tumble dry on high for at least 40 minutes. </p>
                    <p> If infested items are taken out of a room, the bed bugs can fall off and spread the infestation. It is always advisable to treat such items before disposal and these should be wrapped in plastic before removal from the room. For linen, carry the items to the washing machine in garbage bags then dispose of the bags immediately. </p>
                    <p> Thorough vacuuming of carpet edges, skirting boards and all cracks and crevices using a vacuum cleaner with a disposable dust bag is important for removing bed bugs and their eggs. Seal the dust bag in plastic and dispose in your council rubbish bin. </p> <p> Raptor Pest Control recommend removal and either washing or dry cleaning of curtains as these are known areas for infestation.   </p>
                    <h1> Chemical Treatments</h1>
                    <p>Bed bugs have developed a resistance and are difficult to control with domestic aerosol type pesticides.   The eggs are also not destroyed by pesticides so a residual treatment will be required. </p>
                    
                    <p>Treatment will typically be to cracks and crevices where bed bugs are found and will never be applied to bedding where human contact may occur. After the initial treatment, a follow-up inspection should be carried out to determine if further bed 
bugs or eggs are present. In most cases, repeat treatments are required to control bed bugs.</p>
